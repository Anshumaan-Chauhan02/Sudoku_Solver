Solving Sudoku using Backtracking with Inferences - AC3, Naked Pairs and Hidden Pairs. 

Use of backtracking search is applied to solve the sudoku problem. Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heurisitc is used to select the variable for the assignment. This heurisitc promotes early detection of a wrong assignment. 

Inferences are changes made in the domain spcae of unassignbed variables based on already assigned positions. This helps to fasten up the process of solving, as it removes invalid values. Inferences used in backtracking search are as follows:
* AC3 (Arc Consistency) 
* Naked Pairs Candidate 
* Hidden Pair Candidate
